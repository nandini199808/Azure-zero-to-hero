### 🌐 Virtual Network (VNet)

A **Virtual Network** is like your own private network in the cloud. It lets your Azure resources (like VMs, databases, etc.) talk to each other securely.

**✅ Think of it like:** Setting up a private Wi-Fi for all your cloud services.

## Subnets, CIDR

### Subnets

Inside that neighborhood (VNet), you can divide it into **smaller blocks** or streets.

- Each block is a **Subnet**.

- You put related things together (like all web servers in one subnet, all databases in another).
  

### 🧮 CIDR 

**CIDR** is just a fancy way to give your network an address.

**Example**: 10.0.0.0/24 is like saying "this is my whole street of 256 houses (IP addresses)."


### 🛣️ Routes & Route Tables

These are like Google Maps for your network.

**Routes**: Tell your traffic where to go.

**Route Tables:** Hold all your routes in one place.

**Example**: “If someone from Subnet A wants to talk to Subnet B, send them this way.”


### 🚦 Network Security Groups (NSGs)

These are like security guards at the gate.

**You decide:** "Only allow visitors from the front gate, block others."

You can control traffic coming in and going out.

### 🛡️ Application Security Groups (ASGs)

- These are like name tags for your servers.

- Instead of writing rules for every machine, you group them by what they do.

**Example**: All web servers = “WebGroup”

Then, apply one rule to the group — easy and clean.
