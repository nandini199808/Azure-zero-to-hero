# ðŸ”¹ Step 1: What is an Azure Resource?

A resource is anything you create or use in Azure.

ðŸ§¾ Examples:
-------------

- A virtual machine (computer)

- A storage account (to save files)

- A database (to store data)

ðŸ‘‰ You create and manage each one separately.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: What is a Resource Group?
-------------------------------------
- A Resource Group is like a folder.

- You put related resources into one group to manage them together.

ðŸ§¾ Why use it?
---------------
- Easy to organize

- You can delete or update everything in the group at once

- You can give access to your team for only that group

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: What is Azure Resource Manager (ARM)?
--------------------------------------------------
ARM is like a manager in Azure.

It helps you:
--------------
- Create resources automatically using a template (a setup plan)

- Make sure resources are created in the right order

- Fix problems if something goes wrong

- Add tags (labels) to keep resources organized

âœ… In One Line Each:
---------------------
Azure Resource	One item like a VM, storage, or database
