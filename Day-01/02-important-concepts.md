# Vocabulary in Cloud Computing

## Virtualization

Virtualization means creating a fake (virtual) version of something that usually exists physically â€” like a computer, storage, or network.

Instead of buying 10 separate computers (hardware), we can create 10 virtual computers inside one real computer using software.

  ## Why is it Useful?

Saves money (no need to buy extra machines)

Easier to manage and scale

Great for testing, development, and cloud computing

## Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine (VM) is software that acts like a real computer, so you can run other operating systems inside your existing one.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows two software programs to talk to each other and share information.

## Regions

In cloud computing, a Region means a geographic area (like India, US, UK) where cloud companies (like AWS, Azure, GCP) have data centers.

Each Region will have multiple data centers (called Availability Zones).

You can choose a Region closest to your users to get better speed and performance.

## âœ… Example:

Azure "Central India" Region â†’ Data centers located in Pune.

AWS "us-east-1" Region â†’ Data centers in North Virginia, USA.

When you deploy an app or server to a cloud, you choose a Region.

## Availability Zones

An Availability Zone is:
-----------------------

A separate data center inside a Region

Has its own power, cooling, networking

Is physically isolated from other zones in the same region

But they all work together to keep your applications running

ðŸ’¡ Why are AZs important?
----------------------------

If one zone fails (power outage, fire, etc.), the other zones can still run your app

This gives you high availability and fault tolerance

âœ… Real-Life Example:
----------------------

You deploy your app in 2 Availability Zones in the same region.

If one zone crashes, your app still works from the other zone.


## Scalability

Scalability = System can grow or handle more users without breaking or slowing down.

ðŸ’¡ Example 1: Website Traffic
-------------------------------

Imagine your website has 100 visitors today.
Next week, 1,000 people visit it at the same time.

If your system can still work smoothly, without slowing down or crashing â€”
âœ… That means your system is scalable.

## Elasticity

Elasticity means a system can automatically increase or decrease resources depending on how much you need at that time.

ðŸ’» In Cloud Computing:
------------------------
When your website has a lot of visitors, cloud adds more servers to handle the load.

When visitors reduce, cloud removes the extra servers to save cost.

This automatic adjusting is called Elasticity.

## Agility

Agility means being able to change or adapt quickly and easily.

ðŸ’» In Cloud Computing:
-----------------------
You can quickly launch new servers or apps when needed.

If requirements change, you adapt fast without delays.

## High Availability

High Availability means your system or app is always working and available most of the time â€” usually 99.9% or more.

ðŸ’» In Cloud Computing:
-----------------------
Systems are designed so they rarely go down.

Even if one part fails, others take over, so users donâ€™t notice any downtime.


## Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance means a system can keep working without stopping, even if something breaks or goes wrong.

ðŸ’» In Cloud Computing:
-------------------------
If a server or part of the system fails, other servers take over immediately.

Users donâ€™t notice any problem or downtime.

## Disaster Recovery

When something bad happens (like fire, flood, or a big problem with your computer or system),

You have a plan to save your important data and programs,

So you can bring everything back quickly and keep working.

ðŸ’» In Cloud Computing:
----------------------
Cloud providers help you backup your data regularly.

If something goes wrong, you can recover your applications and data fast to avoid long downtime.

## Load Balancing

Instead of sending all visitors to 1 server, visitors are sent to many servers.

This way, no server is overloaded.

Website or app works fast and smoothly.
