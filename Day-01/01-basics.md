# Basics of Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud ?

Imagine you have a big magical computer somewhere far away — on the internet.

You can store your photos, videos, files there.

You can use software or apps that run on that computer.

You don’t need to keep the computer at your home or office.

You can access everything from any device, anywhere, anytime, as long as you have internet.


## What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing means using computers and storage over the internet instead of owning your own physical machines.

- You don’t need to buy or manage expensive servers.

- Instead, you use computers, software, and storage that someone else (a cloud provider) owns and manages.

- You connect through the internet and use what you need.

- These computers are kept in special places called data centers all around the world.


1. Public Cloud
   ---------------

Who uses it: Everyone — individuals, businesses, organizations.

What it is: A big shared computer system on the internet that anyone can use.

Example: Google Drive, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure.

Imagine: Like a huge public park where everyone can come and use the facilities.


2. Private Cloud
   ------------------

Who uses it: Only one organization or company.

What it is: Your own private computer space that only your team can use.

Example: A company’s own secure servers or data centers.

Imagine: Like having a private clubhouse where only invited members can enter.


3. Hybrid Cloud
   -----------------

Who uses it: Organizations that want to use both public and private clouds together.

What it is: A mix of public and private cloud, where some data and apps are on private cloud, and others on public cloud.

Imagine: You use your private clubhouse for important stuff but also visit the public park for other activities.


☁️ Cloud Types: In a Nutshell
-----------------------------

Public Cloud: Shared digital space open to everyone — like a public park online.

Private Cloud: Your exclusive digital space, only for your organization — like a private clubhouse.

Hybrid Cloud: The best of both worlds — using your private space plus the shared cloud as needed.
