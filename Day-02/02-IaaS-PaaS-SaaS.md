# 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

➡️ You do most of the work
---------------------------
It’s like:
🔹 You buy pizza ingredients (flour, cheese, sauce)
🔹 You cook it at home
🔹 You use your oven, but the kitchen is rented

**In Azure:** You get a virtual machine (computer) → You install your software → You manage everything.

# 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

➡️ You only focus on making the pizza (app), kitchen is ready
---------------------------------------------------------------
It’s like:
🔹 You get pre-made pizza dough
🔹 Oven is ready
🔹 You just add toppings and bake

**In Azure:** Azure gives you a platform (like App Service) → You write code → Azure takes care of servers, OS, etc.

# 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

➡️ Everything is done for you
-------------------------------
It’s like:
🔹 You order pizza → It comes to your home → You just eat it!

**In Azure:** You just use ready software (like Microsoft 365 or Gmail).
No setup, no servers, no coding.

🧠 One Line Summary:
----------------------------------------
Model	What You Do	Real-Life Example
